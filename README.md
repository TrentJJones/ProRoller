# ProRoller
ProRoller is a quick 5-minute puzzling platformer where you try to collect mystical artifacts while surrounded by evil Shadow Clones! They copy your every move, and if they get one of the artifacts, it's game over! Be careful though they are much heavier than you and can easily knock you around. Explore the beautifully articulated landscape, gaze at the incredible views of a random construction site, listen to the upbeat and catchy soundtrack, abuse various things wrong with the Unity physics engine, and try not to go flying off the edge! Game Includes: Game. Files relevant to game. 48 collectible mystical artifacts. 24 shadow clones (do not let them out of the box). 5-30 minutes of 'fun', depending on how quickly you figure out the puzzles and what your definition of fun is.
